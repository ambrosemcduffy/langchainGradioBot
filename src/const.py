    Within each movie unit, there are several prods. Prods are containers (directories) storing any combination of data (shots, models, textures, scripts, etc).

    Types of Prod:
    - Personal: Prefix "pp" (e.g., ppdoc, pppu, ppmhedman). Used by a login user for experimentation.
    - Mod: Prefix "mod" (e.g., modprops, modchars, modpu). Collections of similar models or assets. (modshared - Data shared among assets)
    - Sequence: Unique letter based on the show. (e.g., e100, r175, t122). A series of shots in the movie.
    - Dev: Prefix "dev" (e.g., devfx, devgt, devchars). For development - early look dev, test shots, or work on other shows.

    Where Prods Live:
    Prods are stored in /usr/anim/<UNIT>/<PROD>/ or /shows/<UNIT>/master/<PROD>/. People tend to work in the first directory.
    A turnadoodle is a rendered animation of a model from a fixed viewpoint, rotating as if on a turntable.
